  i5 part of the RPGUnit plug-in for
  IBM Rational Developer for Power Systems
--------------------------------------------

The RPGUnit plug-in connects the IBM Rational Developer for Power Systems
with the RPGUnit, that was started by Lacton back in September 2006. It
adds a context menu item to the Remote Systems Explorer to let you run
your RPGUnit test suites directly from the explorer.

The plug-in bases on the code of the RPG Next Gen Editor that is
developed and provided by Mihael Schmidt at http://rpgnextgen.com/.

The i5 part of the plug-in uses an enhanced version of the RPGUnit plug-in
that was originally developed by Laction and continued by Cyril Clemenceau
at http://rpgunit.sourceforge.net/. Unfortunately it seems as if the project
is no longer alive. Nevertheless the original Internet pages at SourceForge
are still a good source of information.

In 2019 Mihael Schmidt and Thomas Raddatz joined iRPGUnit and ILEUnit to
iRPGUnit 3.0.

The Eclipse update site of the plug-in is at:
   https://irpgunit.sourceforge.io/eclipse/rdi8.0/

Let me know your experiences!


--------------------------------------
      Update to v3.0.0 Notice!
--------------------------------------
It is important to know that starting with v3.0.0 source member TESTCASE
has been moved from source file RPGUNIT1 to source file QINCLUDE. Currently
iRPGUnit is shipped with a proxy member in file RPGUNIT1 to ensure backward
compatibility at compile time. This proxy member will be removed after
31.12.2019 with a later version of iRPGUnit.

Ensure to refactor your test suites in time!</b>


--------------------------------------
      Installation Instructions
--------------------------------------

a) Call the A_INSTALL REXX script with:
   STRREXPRC SRCMBR(A_INSTALL) SRCFILE(RPGUNIT/QBUILD) PARM('INSTALL')

b) Optionally run the RPGUnit self tests:
   STRREXPRC SRCMBR(A_SELFTEST) SRCFILE(RPGUNIT/QBUILD) PARM('RPGUNIT')

The following errors are produced by units tests of version 1.10 and lower:

ASSERTT.testAssertWithFailure
   Expected '9800', but was '16800'.
   Reason: Refactoring of module ASSERT. Introduced new procedure doAssert().

ASSERTT.testAssertWithSuccess
   Expected '', but was '
   Reason: The new "assertFailEvt" (assertFailEvtLong_t) had to be mapped to the
           old "assertFailEvt" (assertFailEvt_t) structure, which properly sets
           the length bytes of "assertFailEvt_v1.msg" to x'0000'. These bytes
           had been set to x'4040' before. Procedure ASSERT.clrAssertFailEvt()
           now uses 'clear' instead of '*BLANKS' to initialize the assert fail
           event structure.

ASSERTT.testBigIntegerEquality
   Expected '', but was '
   Reason: see ASSERTT.testAssertWithSuccess

ASSERTT.testGoodByeIsNotHello
   Expected 'assert', but was 'aEqual'.
   Reason: see ASSERTT.testAssertWithFailure

ASSERTT.testHelloEqualsHello
   Expected '', but was '
   Reason: see ASSERTT.testAssertWithSuccess

ASSERTT.testTwoAndTwoEqualsFour
   Expected '', but was '
   Reason: see ASSERTT.testAssertWithSuccess

   Expected 'assert', but was 'iEqual'.
   Reason: see ASSERTT.testAssertWithFailure

RUNT.test_loadTestSuite
   MCH3601 - Pointer not set for location referenced.
   Reason: Parameter srvPgm has been removed from procdure loadTestSuite().

RUNT.test_runTestProc_errorInSetup
   Expected 'E', but was 'F'.
   Reason: see ASSERTT.testAssertWithSuccess

RUNT.test_runTestProc_errorInTearDown
   Expected 'E', but was 'F'.
   Reason: see ASSERTT.testAssertWithSuccess

RUNT.test_runTestProc_errorInTest
   Expected 'E', but was 'F'.
   Reason: see ASSERTT.testAssertWithSuccess

RUNT.test_runTestProc_failureInTest
   Expected 'TEST_FAIL', but was 'fail'.
   Reason: Refactoring of module ASSERT. Introduced new procedure doFail().

   Expected 'E', but was 'F'.
   Reason: see ASSERTT.testAssertWithSuccess

RUACPTST.TESTBIGINTEGER
   Expected 'assert', but was 'iEqual'.
   Reason: see ASSERTT.testAssertWithFailure

RUACPTST.TESTCHOOSETEST
   Expected 'TEST2 (TESTPGM05', but was 'fail (RUTESTCASE'.
   Reason: Refactoring of module ASSERT. Introduced new procedure doFail().

RUACPTST.TESTFAILURES
   Expected 'assert', but was 'iEqual'.
   Reason: see ASSERTT.testAssertWithFailure

RUACPTST.TESTSTACKTRACE
   Expected 'assert', but was 'iEqual'.
   Reason: see ASSERTT.testAssertWithFailure

------------------------
 * Fixed: Now "Runs:" displays the correct number of executed test cases.
 * Changed RPGUnit view to get closer to JUnit.
 * Added: Special thank to Michael Calabro who enhanced RUCRTTST to
   compile SQLRPGLE source members.
 * Added procedure:  MsgInfo_t = getMonitoredMessage(*ON|*OFF)
     Usage:
                 monitor;
                   a = 10;
                   b = 0;     // Attempt made to divide by zero for
                   c = a / b; // fixed point operation. (MCH1211)
                   fail( 'Division by zero did not raise an error.' );
                 on-error;
                   msgInfo = getMonitoredMsg(*ON); // remove message

      Changed:     'assertFailEvt_t'.
      Changed:     Prototypes of setLogContext() and logCompMsg().
      Changed:     'ExcpMsgInfo' references 'Msg_t', now.
      Changed:     Now, handleSuccess() is called regardless of the
                   value of 'detail'. Affects: 'logIdx'.
      Changed:     Formatting of call stack entry.
      Bugfix:      Close spooled file after error (RUACPTST).
      Changed:     Prototypes of getCrtRpgModCmd() and getCrtSrvPgmCmd().
